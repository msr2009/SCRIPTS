    *v0.2 includes a nubmer of major updates including:
        -removal of R as a dependency
        -implementation of visualizations using matplotlib
        -implementation of Scipy/Numpy to perform Poisson tests
        -expurgation of the usage of most Biopython functions (none are now required)
        -significant changes in implementation to reduce runtime to ~2h for a typical data set
        
    *documentation updated to reflect the much simplified installation process

    *v0.2.1b 
	Multiple changes made in filtering structure of pipeline:
		1) In order to add the ability to filter based on the quality of single mutations, 
			rather than whole reads, updated read_fuser to output columns of comma-delimited 
			single-mutation qualities. Then, updated read_aligner to use these quality scores
			to filter, based on inputted threshold (from config_file.)
		2) Updated read_aligner to output reasons for filtering reads in second column of 
			"_qcremoved" file.
		3) Added filtering step to filter based on the number of variant reads in the input
			population - updated map_counts to use a config-defined threshold, above which to 
			keep reads.
	
	Implemented the ability to make pos-avg'd frequency plots log-scaled (currently a bool in 
		code, enrich_plot.py (ln201)). Also, implemented check on zero-division for same plot;
		all zero-division errors get expressed as frequency of 0. Also changed all log() functions
		to take log2, rather than ln.
		
	Added DNA/PRO offset variables (that can be set to make seqID's numbered in relation to entire
		protein sequence, rather than only variable regions) to read_aligner.py.
		
	All settable variables (except log-plotting functionality) were added to config file, and 
		config file scripts were updated to take them into account.
