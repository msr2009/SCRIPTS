read_fuser: The read_fuser module performs several important tasks centered on forming a finished sequence for comparison to the wtDNA configuration element. 

If overlapping read pairs have been acquired, read_fuser stitches these together using the read1_overlap_start, read1_overlap_end, read2_overlap_start, read2_overlap_end, and include_nonoverlap_region parameters. Counting is done from 0, rather than 1. Read2 is considered to be reverse-complemented for the purposes of calculating the overlap start and overlap end.	Thus, in the example above, R2_overlap_start would be 0, whereas read1 start would be at position 22. If the include_nonoverlap_region configuration element were set to y, then the nonoverlap regions above would be appended to the overlapped sequence. Before a full-scale Enrich run is initiated, it is advisable to check that the overlap parameters are set correctly on a small subset of data.
	
For each forward and reverse read pair, read_fuser checks within the overlap region to make sure that the read pairs agree on the identity of each base. If they do not, then read_fuser examines the quality score of each base and picks the base with the higher score.	If both reads have an identical quality score, the base is considered unresolvable and an 'X' is inserted in the finished sequence at the unresolvable position.  Read_fuser also calculates a compound quality score estimate at each position, equal to the product of the two quality scores at that position if the two reads agree on the identity of the position.  If the reads do not agree, the higher quality score is used.	Positions in nonoverlapped regions are assigned their single-read quality score.

In the event that only one read is present, the overlap start and end configuration elements can be used to specify the beginning and end of the region of interest. Finsihed sequences within that region are generated. If only a reverse read is specified, then each read will be reverse-complemented before production of a finished sequence.

If the run_aligner configuration element is set to y, then a Needleman-Wunsch alignment is performed for each read pair which disagrees at more positions than specified in the paired_mismatch_threshold configuration element. Generally, read pairs that contain a large number of mismatches represent deletions within the region of interest and the Needleman-Wunch alignment produces a gap.
