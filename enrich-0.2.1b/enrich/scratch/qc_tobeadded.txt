QC FEATURES TO BE ADDED:
	
	1) Make QC folder to contain all necessary information (in JSON dump) DONE
	
	2) Summary: # of reads total, passed filtration, filtered, unique variants (%single, %double, etc..)
		1) Total number of reads (after read_fuser) DONE in read_fuser
		2) Number of reads in files after read_aligner DONE (counters in read_aligner)

		6) Total variants (map_counts) DONE
		7) Total variants in intersection of sel/unsel ratios files (all, m1, m2) (map_ratios) DONE
	
	3) Average quality at each base along read1 and read2 (DONE in read_fuser)
	
	4) Why rejected reads were rejected? (See MAQ?)
		1) Parse qc_removed file < GRIFFIN DID THIS
	
	5) Where mutations occur in DNA (to check for uniformity of mutagenesis)
		1) map_counts DONE
	
	6) Distribution of # of mutations/variant
		1) map_counts DONE
	
	7) Variants with counts in input, but not in selected (map_ratios) DONE
		
HOW TO DO IT

	1) create qc folder in project directory
	2) create empty file to store JSON dump of data
	3) incrementally add data to JSON file 
		a) open JSON file, parse
		b) add new entry to dict
		c) write to JSON file
